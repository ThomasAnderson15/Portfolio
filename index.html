      <h2 class="centered-text"> About Tommy </h2>

      <p>
        While I was in Highschool, I took 4 years of engineering classes. Working along side other students, I was able to better my skills when it came to group projects, and working with others. I found that teamwork is a crutial part to any project. During those classes I was able to experiment a little bit with writing code. Although I didn't get a great grasp of the concept, I was intrigued enough to start looking into some schooling options. 
      </p>
      <p>
        After graduating I found <a href= "https://www.thinkful.com/" target="_blank">Thinkful</a>. I jumped on the opportunity and dove head-first into coding lessons and tutorials. Learning the fundamentals for coding and web development has grown my passion and excites me to learn more every chance I get. After logging many hours of coding and web-design practice, I am proud to say I am a student at Thinkful! I hope one day the skills I Learn will translate over to a job in the coding field.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of coding, I have many hobbies and intersest. One of my favorite things to do is play videogames with my friends. If im not coding or playing videogames you would most likely find me playing basketball or watching my favorite sports teams. Being from the Philadelphia area, my favorite sports teams are the 76ers and the Eagles.
